## Fetch-Rewards-Interview-Submission
 
This is my interview submission for the Fetch Rewards Apprenticeship. The application was developed using Java in Android Studio.


# Background
Previously, I have worked on Android apps using Dart and the Flutter framework. Leveraging my existing knowledge of Android app development in Dart and Flutter, I applied the concepts to this project. The experience gained from this exercise has motivated me to further explore the roles of both Java and Kotlin in Android development.

This project served as my first experience with Java for Android app development. Throughout the week, I immersed myself in local Android development, which involved installing Android Studio, utilizing Java to access an API, and implementing Unit Tests. Despite the time constraints, I managed to complete most of the application while simultaneously teaching myself the intricacies of Android development in Java.

# Instructions to Run the Application
Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

1) Download the project from this GitHub repository.
2) Open the project in Android Studio.
3) Click the build button to compile the project.
4) Click the run button in Android Studio to start the emulator and launch the application.

Please note that you might need to set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) if you don't have a physical Android device connected to your computer.
